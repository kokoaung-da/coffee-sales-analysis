# Coffee Sales Dashboard

Built an interactive sales dashboard using Power Pivot data modeling with linked Order, Product, and Customer tables. Applied DAX measures to calculate total and segmented sales by roast type, size, and region. Revealed that 80% of revenue came from the U.S. and that Arabica and Liberica dominated sales, guiding marketing and inventory planning decisions.

**Coffee Sales Dashboard — Business Insights**

- 1. **Sales Performance by Coffee Type**

  - **Arabica and Liberica** show frequent sales peaks, indicating high seasonal demand.
  - **Robusta** sales remain consistently lower, suggesting an opportunity to either **reduce inventory** or **reposition marketing** toward its unique strengths (e.g., affordability or caffeine content).
  - **Recommendation:** Focus marketing campaigns and promotions on top-performing types like *Arabica* and *Liberica* while exploring bundling or rebranding for underperforming ones.

- 2. **Sales by Geography**

  - The **United States** contributes the **majority of total revenue ($35.6K)** — over **80% of total sales**, showing a strong dependency on a single market.
  - **Ireland ($6.7K)** and **United Kingdom ($2.8K)** have relatively small shares.
  - **Recommendation:** Diversify the customer base by expanding marketing in European regions. Target localized campaigns or online sales channels to boost international presence and reduce reliance on the US market.

---

- 3. **Customer Segmentation Insights**

  - The **Top 5 Customers** contribute significantly to overall sales, led by *Allis Wilmore* and *Brenn Dundredge*, each with over **300 units purchased**.
  - This suggests a **high-value customer segment** that drives recurring revenue.
  - **Recommendation:** Implement a **loyalty or VIP reward program** for top customers to increase retention and encourage repeat purchases.

---

- 6. **Loyalty Program Analysis**

  - The inclusion of a **“Loyalty Card” filter** enables segmentation between members and non-members.
  - This provides an opportunity to **measure the direct impact of loyalty programs** on purchase frequency and basket size.
  - **Recommendation:** Strengthen the loyalty program if data shows higher spending among members — encourage sign-ups via discounts or exclusive offers.
